* Configuration files
  These configuration files clearly reflect my personal taste. I try to maintain them in order to be easily reusable but they remain adapted to my personal needs.
** Prerequisites
   - Zsh                             -> configuration framework: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
   -- stow (easily install dotfiles) -> distro package
   -- fzf (zsh, vim fuzzy find)      -> distro package or https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
   -- starship (shell prompt)        -> https://starship.rs/
   - Neovim                          -> plugins loaded with Lazy: https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim
   -- luajit or lua 5.1.0
   -- fd (find replacement)          -> https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
   -- ripgrep (grep replacement)     -> https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
   -- bat (cat replacement)          -> https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
   - Tmux                            -> plugins installed via tpm: https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm
   - Vim                             -> plugins loaded with vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
** Installation
   Clone the repository
*** Via stow (recommended)
    From the cloned repo and having stow installed you can simply:
    @code bash
    stow -t $HOME <app>
    @end
    Example of installing vim and tmux configs for user voltux:
    @code bash
    stow -t /home/voltux vim tmux
    @end
*** Manually
    Copy (if you are happy with the current version) or symlink (if you want to stay up to date with the repo) everything contained in the root of every package config to the desired user's $HOME directory.
